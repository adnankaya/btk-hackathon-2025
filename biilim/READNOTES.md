# Workflow
This workflow outlines the user journey from initial interaction to continuous learning and mastery, powered by your chosen technology stack.

1. User Onboarding & Profile Creation
Action: User opens the app for the first time.

System: Presents a Registration/Login screen.

Action: User registers or logs in.

System: Initiates an Onboarding Questionnaire.

Asks for basic demographics (name, age, general location: city/country, cultural background context).

Asks for hobbies/interests.

Asks for preferred learning "sensory" styles (visual, auditory, reading/writing, kinesthetic/doing, simulation, real-world practice).

System: Stores user profile data in PostgreSQL. This data informs AI personalization.

2. Initial Topic Selection
Action: After onboarding, the user is prompted: "What do you want to learn today?"

System: Provides a prominent Search/Topic Input field.

Action: User types in a topic (e.g., "Photosynthesis," "Python Decorators," "World War II causes").

System (Optional): Presents an "Upload Document" button for specific study materials, or "Browse/Suggest" options for discovery.

3. Learning Session Initialization
System (AI - LangChain/LangGraph, Google Gemini API):

Motivation & Promise: Greets the user, acknowledges the chosen topic, and provides a motivating statement with initial use cases/benefits (e.g., "Learning [Topic] is fascinating and will help you [Benefit]!").

Clarifying Questions: Asks simple, multiple-choice questions to gauge current familiarity (e.g., "Beginner," "Some knowledge," "Deepen understanding").

Table of Contents / Learning Path: Presents a high-level, AI-generated outline of the topic, broken into segments (e.g., "What is X?", "Key Components," "How it Works").

Action: User confirms the learning path or requests adjustments.

System (UI): Displays the Table of Contents with progress indicators.

4. Core Content Delivery Loop (Per Segment)
System (UI): Activates a Timer/Focus Feature (e.g., Pomodoro) for the current segment.

System (AI - LangChain/LangGraph, Google Gemini API):

Content Delivery: Delivers the segment's content, dynamically adapting to the user's preferred learning style:

Visual: Concise text + AI-generated image/diagram (via image generation API or charting library).

Storytelling: Concise narrative (150-300 words).

Informative: Structured text (bullet points, etc.).

Auditory: Text-to-Speech (TTS) output of the explanation.

Kinesthetic/Simulation: Description of an activity or a prompt for an interactive element.

Feedback Prompt: Asks, "Does this help you understand, or would you like another approach?"

Action: User provides feedback (e.g., "Yes, understood," "Need more," "Try another style").

System (AI - LangChain/LangGraph, Google Gemini API):

Remediation (if needed): If the user struggles or requests more, the AI offers alternative explanations (simpler, different style, real-world examples, focus on specific parts) and generates new content accordingly.

System (UI): Shows "checked/completed" sign for the segment in the Table of Contents.

5. Micro-Quiz & Immediate Reinforcement
System (AI - LangChain/LangGraph, Google Gemini API): After each segment is delivered, presents a Micro-Quiz (1-3 non-graded questions: MC, T/F, fill-in-the-blank, simple open-ended).

Action: User answers the quiz questions.

System (AI): Provides Immediate Feedback for each answer ("Correct!" or "Not quite, [explanation]").

System (AI):

If Successful: "Excellent! Ready for the next section?"

If Struggling: "It seems we need to revisit this. Would you like me to explain it differently, or focus on a specific part?" (Loops back to Remediation in Step 4).

6. Practice & Application
Trigger: After a major topic (multiple segments) is completed, or as a remediation step.

System (AI - LangChain/LangGraph, Google Gemini API):

Suggests Practice: Offers virtual simulations (HTML/CSS/JS interactive elements) or real-world activities.

Provides Instructions: Gives clear steps for the practice.

Action: User engages in practice.

Action: User reports observations/results (text/audio).

System (AI): Evaluates the practice outcome and provides feedback.

7. In-Depth Explanation (Feynman Technique)
Trigger: After a major topic is "completed" (segments and micro-quizzes passed), or upon user request.

System (AI - LangChain/LangGraph, Google Gemini API): Prompts the user: "Explain [Major Topic] in your own words, as if teaching a 10-year-old."

Action: User provides explanation (audio via Speech-to-Text, or text input).

System (AI): Uses NLP to evaluate clarity, completeness, and accuracy.

System (AI): Provides detailed, constructive feedback, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement. Offers targeted remediation.

8. Mastery Tracking & Spaced Repetition
System (Backend - Celery, PostgreSQL): Continuously updates an internal "knowledge graph" or "concept strength" score for each topic/sub-topic based on:

Micro-quiz performance.

Feynman explanation quality.

Practice success.

(Future: Confidence ratings).

System (Backend - Celery, PostgreSQL): Schedules future review sessions for concepts based on a spaced repetition algorithm (e.g., SM-2), prioritizing weaker areas.

System (UI/AI): Periodically prompts the user for review sessions based on the spaced repetition schedule.

9. Gamification Integration
Points: Awarded for segment completion, correct quiz answers, explanations, focused sessions, practice, and daily logins.

Badges/Achievements: Earned for topic mastery, skill demonstration, consistency, and quest completion.

Levels: Progression based on accumulated points/achievements.

Quests/Challenges: AI-generated, goal-oriented learning paths with specific completion criteria.

UI: Visual display of points, earned badges, current level, and active quests.

10. Continuous Motivation & Support
System (AI - LangChain/LangGraph, Google Gemini API):

Provides Personalized Encouragement and affirmation based on progress and effort.

Detects signs of overwhelm/frustration and offers Adaptive Pacing & Pressure Management (breaks, simpler explanations, topic changes).

Facilitates Collaborative Goal Setting and visualizes progress.

Fosters Curiosity by connecting topics to real-world relevance and asking thought-provoking questions.

Adapts Communication Style (tone, humor) based on user interaction.

Celebrates Milestones with personalized congratulations.
